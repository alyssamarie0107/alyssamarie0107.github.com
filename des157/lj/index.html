                <h2 class="title">Best practices for form design <span>by Salim Ansari</span></h2>
                <p>
                    In the article, “Best practices for form design”, Salim Ansari gives the reader twenty tips that will increase form usability. 
                    In short, Ansari’s article provides detailed information on the do’s and don'ts to form design. I agree with all the practices 
                    Ansari mentions, but the ones that stood out the most to me were to minimize the input fields, auto-focus the first input field, 
                    and accessibility. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ansari, reminds the reader that “less is more”, and that is exactly why product designers should follow minimizing the input fields, 
                    such that the user only inputs the most relevant information in a form. As a computer science student who is trying to hone their 
                    front-end skills, I appreciate designing tips, such as auto-focusing the active input field of a form by highlighting it using a bold 
                    border or shadow so that users could know from a glace, where the focus is. Moreover, accessibility is very important to remember while 
                    designing, for all users should be able to enjoy what we create. For instance, we should not rely on color so much to communicate a certain 
                    status, but also have alternatives for color blind people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I learned that it is important to make a form simple to understand, straightforward, and easy to fill-in. As a result, following 
                    these best practices will help significantly increase usability.

                    <a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/">Here</a> is a link to Urban Outfitter's website. I interact a lot with this website's form for when I checkout. The form does appear to follow
                    most of the best practices that Ansari mentions. For instance, it asks the easy questions first, puts the label above the input field, sizes fields 
                    accordingly, auto-focuses the active input field, and displays form feedback. However, it can improve by removing the asterik (*) that represent 
                    required fields and instead put '(optional)' for the optional fields.
