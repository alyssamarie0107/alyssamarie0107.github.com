                I was glad to see that one of the first things Peter did when the page loaded was hover over the thank you(s) because I was worried that users will not experience this user interaction. Some probably won't be as curious as Peter, however, I don't think I am going to put an explicit instruction or note that this is an available interaction to the user.

                Peter enjoyed the background changing when he scrolled through page. He also liked my color scheme. One thing he suggested was to add some sort of animation for when the color changes just so that it is not so abrupt.

                Peter hover overed the images of the people and clicked on them. He liked the personalized thank you messages a lot, and suggested to also add an animation for when it appears. He also noticed that when the thank you message appears, it moves the image of the person. Thus, he suggested that I find a way for that to not happen. Overall, Peter liked my final project, especially the photographs I included.
