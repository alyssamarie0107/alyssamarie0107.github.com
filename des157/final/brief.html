            <h2>Project Summary:</h2>
            <p>
                I will be updating the Every Picture Studio Project. Since I am about to graduate this upcoming month, I would like to say "thank you" to my "collection" of family and friends, for sticking by my side and supporting me through it all. In my Every Picture Project, I highlighted my vintage cameras and when a user clicks on the name of the camera, an overlay of pictures would appear of either my family, friends, or landscapes. However, I would like to refine this studio to just be my family and friends because without them, I would not be where I am today.

                The website above is a Craig Reynold's photography portfolio. The interface design is modern and minimal. I like the black and white color palette chosen because it makes the photographs, which are in color, stand out more. I also thought that having the photographer's name, Craig Reynolds, in the center of the website and in a large font size was effective and I like the font chosen. The interaction design is amazing, for when you hover over the photographer's name, pictures that he has taken appear and fade away. After going through the website and interacting with it, it leaves a memorable mark on the user.

                Craig Reynold's website shares content and intention with my final project. I plan to highlight photos as well, but of my family and friends. I am inspired by his website, especially the interactions. I am thiking of using the idea of having a large font for my family or friends' names and when you hover over it, pictures of them and memories I shared with them appear and fade away.

                The website above is another photographer's portfolio, Turi Kirknes. The design is no longer her current one on her website, thus I was not able to interact with the design shown above, which was found on awwards. However, the link provided shows a short video of the interface and interaction design. I enjoy the interface, especailly the structure of the photos and heading. It reminds me of the viewfinder reel toy. However, instead of pressing on a button, you scroll to see the next photo, which leads to the interaction design of this website. I like how the website makes it apparent to scroll by having partly visible pictures, while showing the photo you are currently on fully.

                This website also shares content and intention with my final project, for it highlights a specific collection of photos. The idea of showcasing my family and friends, similar to this website is appealing to me. I really liked the "reel" feel and can see how each section can be one of my family and friends with their name and a small message.

                My goals for this final project is to challenge my creativity and step out of my comfort zone with user interactions and animations.

            <h2>Design Strategies:</h2>
            <p>
                For the overall look, I plan to go for a modern and rustic look and feel. I would like to put emphasis on the names of the people who have helped and supported me through my journey in college. Thus, I plan to use oversized typography, simialr to Craig Reynold's portfolio. To achieve a modern look and feel, I will have a mix of whites, greys, and soft tones. I also plan to have white space. Additionally, to achieve a rustic sort of look and feel, I plan for my visual images to have a film aestheic: grainy and faded.

            <h2>Experience Goals:</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for the user experience is to make it memorable and unique. I plan to achieve this by having intriguing and effective interactions. I also have the goal to make the experience heartwarming by displaying my support system and leaving a small thank you message for each person.
