                    <p>
                        This website is a "thank you" to my family and friends who have supported me throughout my
                        univeristy journey. Many people have helped me get to this point in my life and I wish I could
                        show every single person. However, for the sake of space, I chose a handful of people who have
                        impacted my life and can't imagine life without them. I can't thank them enough because I truly
                        would not be where I am today without them. This project is dedicated to them. &#10084;

                            To my family, I truly can't thank you guys enough. You all witnessed my late nights studying
                            or
                            doing homework, you all witnessed my tears when I was stressed or overwhelmed. You all
                            witnessed
                            my relief and smile when I passed a test or class. You guys witnessed it all. What all those
                            moments have in common is that you were all there to support, celebrate, and lift me up in
                            every
                            way possible. Without you all, this accomplishment of graduating would not have been
                            possible.
                            This is not just for me, but I did it all for you guys as well. Thank you for the constant
                            support and love.

                            To my best friend, "partna", and sister, Cat, there are no words that do justice that
                            express my
                            gratitude for you and our friendship. You have kept me afloat through it all, especially
                            these past couple of months. It's honestly not an overstatement to say that you've saved me
                            and that you still are today. Thank you for motivating me during the days I did not want to
                            do anything at all, especially school. Thank you for celebrating my accomplishments with me,
                            small or big. Thank you for listening to me vent about my classes, even if you have no idea
                            what I am talking about. Thank you reminding me that it is okay to take breaks and to rest.
                            Thank you for being here and always being someone I can turn to. You do so much for me, and
                            always know, I will do the same for you. Lastly, thank you for making my time at Davis so
                            memorable. Living with you at 339 has been one of the best things in my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As this chapter in our lives comes to a close, I am excited and thankful to continue to live
                            with you in our dream city, San Francisco. I couldn't ask for a better person to be
                            "adulting"
                            with. I love you bro. SF is not ready for us!

                            Keana Jennelle, where do I begin with you? You and I have been best friends for as long as I
                            can remember. Our friendship is one that remains close my heart. Life with you is better and
                            you bring so much color and joy into my life. There is not a thing in this world that I
                            would not do for you. You have my back and I have yours. What I love about our friendship is
                            that we get each other. You see me and I see you. You're my person. Always. Nothing is going
                            to change that.

                            Bri, you are one of the reasons why I can look back at my time in Davis and my college
                            journey in general and smile with so much joy. I will forever cherish the moments we
                            carpooled to campus, our philz study dates, mango, mojito, and wine nights lol, and just
                            coming home to you and Cat after a long day. Living with you at 339 is unforgettable.

                            are the definition of a best friend. There has never been a time where you were not there
                            for me. It seems like you always know what to say or know what to do when I am feeling "fine
                            with a y".

                            Thank you for getting me through the home stretch. I have told you countless of times how I
                            don't think I can't do it anymore and how I want to give up. However, you pushed me when I
                            couldn't push myself. You lifted me up when I was low and weak. You believed in me so much
                            to where I started to believe in myself again. Thank you. Thank you for being my best friend
                            and more. I love you.

                            Zech, our friendship is very special to me. I like how we always pick up where we left off.
                            It's crazy to me how we are still close till this day. We don't see each other often, but
                            lately we've been talking more and building a website together!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's pretty scary how much we have in common. Anyways, I just want to say thank you. You've
                            been a constant in my life and I appreciate you for always checking in on me and being here
                            for me. Always know that I'll always be here for you too. I look forward to what the future
                            has in store for us. I am manifesting that we will continue to work together lol.
                        </p>
                        <p>Love always, Alyssa</p>
